For this prototype, we have implemented partial completion of environment interactions.

The player is able to walk on rope and walk across small ledges,
in addition, the player is able to jump.

## NOTE
 - The game is controlled using a Xbox controller.
 - The working scene is the SampleScene.
 - Animations and player models are not final.

## Character Controller
The player is controlled using the Character Controller component.
All movement, and jumping should be implemented through that.
The majority of the control logic can be found in PlayerContol script's Update method,
which is attached to the player object.
